# intro_to_algorithms_CLRS
I am studying the book "Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, Clifford Stein" or in other words CLRS. And in this Rep i have coded and solved it's algorithms and exercises, Problems.
But still it's long way to go so would say **keep watching** 
Thanks.
